# vocalino_v0.1_voice_acting_pipeline
Open-source voice acting pipeline combining zero-shot voice cloning with natural-language direction. Provide a reference voice (or generate one) and describe how the line should be performed. Produces speech that keeps the voice identity while following emotional and stylistic prompts—no training required.
